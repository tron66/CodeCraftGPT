CodeCraft GPT is an innovative, all-in-one platform harnessing the power of advanced Language Models (OpenAI). It seamlessly integrates four key components to elevate the coding experience for developers.

## Prerequisites

Before using this application, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python:**
    - This project requires Python. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    - You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **OpenAI API Key:**
   - To access certain features and functionalities, you'll need a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
   - If you don't have an API key, you can obtain one by following the instructions on the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

3. **LangChain:**
    - LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models. As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis. Learn about [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/).

4. **Streamlit:**
    - Streamlit is a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. It is a Python-based library specifically designed for machine learning engineers. Learn about [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). [Installation requirements](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation)

5. **Streamlit-Option-Menu:**
    - streamlit-option-menu is a simple Streamlit component that allows users to select a single item from a list of options in a menu. It is similar in function to st. selectbox(), except that: It uses a simple static list to display the options instead of a dropdown. Learn about [Streamlit-Option-Menu](https://github.com/victoryhb/streamlit-option-menu#:~:text=streamlit%2Doption%2Dmenu-,streamlit%2Doption%2Dmenu%20is%20a%20simple%20Streamlit%20component%20that%20allows,options%20instead%20of%20a%20dropdown).

## How to Set Up the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Navigate to your workspace
2. Create a virtual environment by running: `python -m venv env`
3. Activate your virtual environment based on your operating system::

   **Windows:**
   `env/Scripts/activate`

   **Linux or MacOS:**
   `source env/bin/activate`

4. Install dependencies by running the command:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. In the root directory create a folder called **.streamlit** and inside the folder create a file called **secrets.toml**

   Inside the  `secrets.toml` file add the OpenAI PI key following:

    ```toml
       # secrets.toml

        OPENAI_API_KEY="<ADD your OPEN AI API KEY for local Development>"
    ```

6. Run the application using the following command:

    `streamlit run main.py`

Ensure you follow these steps to successfully set up and run the project. You're ready to explore the full capabilities of our AI-powered development tools.
